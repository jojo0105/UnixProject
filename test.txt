After all the team is able to write changes and retrieve other members’ changes, we’ll go to the conflict practice. A conflict will occur if you try to push to the remote repository, but your changes are based in an older version than what is currently online. If you are working by yourself, you can still perform this practice by cloning the repository in different locations in your filesystem. You will have 2 different local repositories, that will behave just as if they were two clones by different users, so conflicts between the local repositories will occur in the same way.
